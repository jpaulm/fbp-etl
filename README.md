FBP-ETL
=======

#### ETL (Extract-Transform-Load) framework based on JavaFBP

This is really a kit for building Extract-Transform-Load applications.  We will be showing how a simple network can be developed and expanded using custom- and pre-coded components, to allow endless combinations of databases, files, and network communication, to quickly develop ETL-type applications. 

The various phases will be designated `Stepxx`, but they will not necessarily have to be traversed in sequence.
