FBP-ETL
=======

#### ETL (Extract-Transform-Load) framework based on JavaFBP

This is really a kit for building Extract-Transform-Load applications.  We will be showing how a simple network can be developed and expanded using custom- and pre-coded components, to allow endless combinations of databases, files, and network communication, to quickly develop ETL-type applications. 

From the point of view of Flow-Based Programming (FBP) there is nothing special about ETL:  in this project we will be demonstrating many of the capabilities of FBP in the context of extracting, transforming and loading, using a mixture of precoded and custom components.

The various phases will be designated `Stepxx`, but the numbers will not necessarily be consecutive.
