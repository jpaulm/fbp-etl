#### Adding Customized Types to ReadJDBC.java 

So far, we have been using standard data types (SQL and Java).  However, as we have said in a number of publications, "BigDecimal" or, still worse, "float", are not adequate for monetary amounts.  We are therefore planning to convert the `Book` layout to use `MPrice` from https://github.com/jpaulm/jbdtypes - which see.  We will also be adding a type `PRICE` to the database column definitions.  This has necessitated a certain amount of retroactive restructuring to this project.
